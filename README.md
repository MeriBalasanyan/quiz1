A Queue is a simple data structure concept that can be applied in our daily life, like when we stand in a line to buy bread.
Queues are open from both ends meaning elements are added from the back and removed from the front (by first-in-first-out principle).
The points of entry and exit are different: enqueue - adding an element to a Queue, dequeue - removing an element from a Queue. Random 
access is not allowed - we cannot add or remove an element from the middle.
